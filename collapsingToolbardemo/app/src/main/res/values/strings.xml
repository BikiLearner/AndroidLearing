    <string name="article">Hello guys, curation is one of my passion and so is reading. I read a lot, here in Medium, On Reddit, On HackerNews, and in general other places on the Internet. While reading so many articles I have noticed one thing that sometimes a good article doesn’t get the exposure it deserves and when I see that I feel for them.

It takes a lot of hard work, time, and patience to write an article and there is nothing more frustrating to find that only a handful of your friends have read it.

Java Community has given so much love to me and I am really grateful I felt that I should also do something for new writers and bloggers and Java developers who write and that’s why I have created this
Medium
 Publication, Javarevisited.

If you follow me that you know that I solely write on my blog Javarevisited and Java67 but in this place, it’s not just me but other Java programmer and developer who also gets a chance to write and share their thoughts.

Apart from that, I have also started a series of curation articles, where I will share some worth reading Java articles from Medium so that you can read some interesting articles and those articles also get more exposure they deserve before falling on the sea.

So, here is my first such curated list of best Java articles of this week from Medium:</string>
